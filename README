Introduction to Pi3D
====================

**Pi3D written by Tim Skillman, Paddy Gaunt, Tom Ritchford Copyright (c) 2016**

There's plenty of 3D code flying around at the moment for the Raspberry Pi,
but much of it is rather complicated to understand and most of it can sit
under the bonnet!

pi3d is a Python module that aims to greatly simplify writing 3D in Python
whilst giving access to the power of the Raspberry Pi GPU. It enables both
3D and 2D rendering and aims to provide a host of exciting commands to load
in textured/animated models, create fractal landscapes, shaders and much more.

v1.7 release of the pi3d module adds support for
running on platforms other than the raspberry pi (X on linux) and runs with
python 3 as well as 2 The OpenGLES2.0 functionality of the Raspberry Pi
is used directly or via mesa on 'big' machines. This makes it generally *faster*
and opens up the world of *shaders* that allow effects such as normal and 
reflection maps, blurring and many others. It has various demos of built-in
shapes, landscapes, model loading, walk-about camera and much more! See the demos
included with this code and experiment with them ..

If you are reading this document as the ReadMe in the repository then you
can find the full version of the documentation here
http://pi3d.github.com/html/index.html

Demos for Pi3D are now stored at https://github.com/pi3d/pi3d_demos
===================================================================
N.B. Shaders are now integrated into programs differently. The syntax used
to be::

    myshader = pi3d.Shader('shaders/uv_flat')

and is now::

    myshader = pi3d.Shader('uv_flat')

this will use the default shaders 'bundled' with the package. The old format
will be interpreted as 'look in a subdirectory of the directory where the demo
is being run from.' This is probably what you would do if you rolled your own
special shaders for your own project.

Download, Extract and install
=============================

    If you have pip installed you should be able to open a terminal and
    type::

      sudo pip install pi3d
    
    Otherwise you can download from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pi3d
    and extract the package then in a terminal::

      sudo python setup.py install

    (or you may need to use python3) this will put the package into the
    relevant location on your device (for instance
    /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/) allowing it to be imported
    by your applications.
    
    The latest code can be obtained from https://github.com/tipam/pi3d/
    where there is a ``Download ZIP`` link, or you can install git then
    clone using ``git clone https://github.com/tipam/pi3d.git`` this git
    method will give you the option to update the code by running, from
    the pi3d directory ``git pull origin master``

Setup on the Raspberry Pi
=========================

#.  **Memory Split setup**

    Although most demos work on 64MB of memory, you are strongly advised to have
    a 128MB of graphics memory split, especially for full-screen 3D graphics.
    In the latest Raspbian build you need to either run ``sudo raspi-config``
    or edit the config.txt file (in the boot directory) and set the variable
    ``gpu_mem=128`` for 128MB of graphics memory.


#.  **Install Python Imaging**

    Before trying any of the demos or Pi3D, you must download the Python Imaging
    Library as this is needed for importing any graphics used by Pi3. The original
    Imaging library is no longer really maintained and doesn't run on python_3.
    The better equivalent replacement is Pillow however a couple of issues
    relating to text vertical alignment will not be corrected unti the Oct2013
    issue. To install Pillow you need to::

      sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev libfreetype6-dev
      sudo apt-get install python-pip
      sudo pip install Pillow
      ...

    If you miss any of the dependent libraries and need to add them later
    you will have to ``pip uninstall`` then re ``pip install``

    For python_3 support the first above will provide the required graphics
    libraries used by Pillow but you will need to swap to ``python3-dev``
    and ``python3-setuptools`` also pip is different::

      sudo apt-get install python3-pip
      sudo pip-3.2 install Pillow

    If you do not intend to run python_3 and need nicely aligned text
    strings over the short term you can install the old PIL:  on the
    terminal, type::

      sudo apt-get install python-imaging

    If you later switch to Pillow you will need to sudo remove python-imaging
    first

    [To run on Arch linux you will need to install::

      pacman -S python2
      pacman -S python-imaging
      pacman -S python2-numpy

    this worked for me. Presumably you would need the pacman equivalent of
    all the installations outlined above for Pillow and python_3]

Setup on alternative Linux platforms
====================================

#.  The machine will need to have a gpu that runs OpenGL2+ and obviously
    it will need to have python installed. If the Linux is running in vmware
    you will need to 'enable 3d acceleration'. You need to install libraries
    that emulate OpenGLES behaviour for the gpu::

      sudo apt-get install mesa-utils-extra

    This should install libEGL.so.1 and libGLESv2.so.2 if these change
    (which I suppose they could in time) then the references will need to
    be altered in pi3d/constants/__init__.py

    The installation of PIL or Pillow should be the same as above but you
    are more likely to need to manually install python-numpy or python3-numpy

Editing scripts and running
===========================

#.  **Install Geany to run Pi3D**

    Although you can use any editor and run the scripts in a terminal using python,
    Geany is by far the easiest and most compatible application to use for creating
    and running Python scripts. Download and install it with::

      sudo apt-get install geany xterm

#.  **Optionally, install tk.**

    Some of the demos require the tk graphics toolkit.  To download and install it::

      sudo apt-get install tk

#.  **Load and run**

    Either run from the terminal ``python3 ~/pi3d/demos/Minimal.py`` or
    load any of the demos into Geany and run (using the cogs icon). As a minimum,
    scripts need these elements in order to use the pi3d library::

      import pi3d
      DISPLAY = pi3d.Display.create(w=128, h=128)
      shader = pi3d.Shader("2d_flat")
      sprite = pi3d.ImageSprite("textures/PATRN.PNG", shader)
      while DISPLAY.loop_running():
        sprite.draw()

    But.. a real application will need other code to actually do something, for
    instance to get user input in order to stop the program!


A Very Brief Explanation
========================

The whole idea of Pi3d is that you don't have to get involved in too many of
the nuts and bolts of how the OpenGL graphics processor works however it might
help to get an overview of the layout of Pi3d. More detailed explanations can
be found in the documentation of each of the modules. Read http://pi3d.github.io/html/FAQ.html before
you try anything ambitious or if anything goes wrong, obviously. There is a
http://pi3d.github.io/html/GPUexplain.html where I try to explain in some more detail what
is going on.


  **Display** The `Display` class is the core and is used to hold screen dimension information,
  to initiate the graphics functionality and for 'central' information, such as timing,
  for the animation. There needs to be an instance of `Display` in existence
  before some of the other objects are created so it's a good idea to create one
  first job.
  
  **Shape** `All objects to be drawn by Pi3d` inherit from the `Shape` class which holds
  details of position, rotation, scale as well as specific data needed for
  drawing the shape. Each `Shape` contains an array of `Buffer` objects; normally
  only containing one but there could be more in complicated models created
  with external 3D applications. 
  
  **Buffer** The `Buffer` objects contain the arrays of values representing vertices,
  normals, faces and texture coordinates in a form that can be quickly read by
  the graphics processor. Each Buffer object within a `Shape` can be textured
  using a different image or shade (RGB) value and, if needed, a different `Shader`
  
  **Shader** The `Shader` class is used to compile *very fast* programs that are run on
  the graphics processor. They have two parts: *Vertex Shaders* that do calculation
  for each of the vertices of the `Buffer` and *Fragment Shaders* applied to
  each pixel. In Pi3d we have kept the shaders out of the main python files
  and divided them using the two extensions .vs and .fs The shader language
  is C like, very clever indeed, but rather hard to fathom out.
  
  **Camera** In order to draw a `Shape` on the `Display` the `Shader` needs to be passed the
  vertex information in the Buffers and needs know how the `Shape` has been moved.
  But it also needs to know how the `Camera` has moved. The `Camera` class generally
  has just one instance and if you do not create one explicitly then `Display` will
  generate a default one when you first try to draw something. The `Camera`
  has position and rotation information similar to Shapes but also information
  to create the view, such as how wide-angle or telephoto the lens is.
  
  **Texture** The `Texture` objects are used to load images from file into a form that
  can be passed to the `Shader` to draw onto a surface. They can also be applied as
  normal maps to give much finer local detail or as reflection maps - a much
  faster way to make surfaces look shiny than ray tracing.
  
  **Light** To produce a 3D appearance most of the Shaders use directional lighting and
  if you draw a `Shape` without creating a `Light` a default instance will be
  created by the `Display`. The `Light` has properties defining the direction,
  the colour (and strength i.e. RGB values) and ambient colour (and strength).

  When you look through the demos you will see one or two things that may
  not be immediately obvious. All the demos start with::
  
    #!/usr/bin/python
    from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals

  Although these lines can often be left out, the first tells any process running the file
  as a script that it's python and the second is basically to help the transition
  of this code to run using python 3::
  
    import demo

  Allows the demo files to be put in a subdirectory but still run. If you write
  a program in the top directory then you will need to take this out::
  
    import pi3d

  Is an alternative to importing just what you need i.e.::
  
    from pi3d.constants import *
    from pi3d import Display
    from pi3d.Texture import Texture
    from pi3d.Keyboard import Keyboard
    from pi3d.Light import Light
    from pi3d.Shader import Shader
    from pi3d.util.String import String
    ...
    from pi3d.shape.Sphere import Sphere
    from pi3d.shape.Sprite import Sprite

  If you import the whole lot using ``import pi3d`` then you need to prefix classes
  and functions with ``pi3d.`` And you are loading a large number of variable names
  which might cause a conflict, isn't as explicit and is less tidy (in the non-
  superficial sense)! A third way to import the modules would be to use
  ``from pi3d import *`` this saves having to use the ``pi3d.`` prefix but
  is **much harder to debug** if there is a name conflict.
