===============
Tim Skillman, Patrick Gaunt, Tom Ritchford

Date        Amends

v1.0
2013-08-16  Support for other linux platforms using xlib and mesa. Runs under
            python3 using six. Memory leaks fixed. Unicode, multiline and justified
            String. DogFight demo using multiplayer networking (urllib to
            MySQL php server) Point rendering option added. Shadow casting
            onto ElevationMap. MergeShape takes array of Shapes so much
            quicker for assemblies of large numbers of objects. Slideshow
            demo loads resources in background thread. Fixed z position
            bug in 2d_flat/Canvas system. Added alpha value as a uniform
            variable to allow shaders to fade objects.

v0.8
2013-05-29  Switch to a non-zero-padded version number

v0.08
2013-02-08  Wholesale conversion to OpenGL ES2.0 mechanisms. As much as possible
            of the existing functionality has been maintained though some classes
            have not yet been implemented: [collisionMap, Missile] some are done
            differently: [Draw, DrawString2D] The structure of the module has been
            broken into a directory structure with smaller files generally containing
            one class. Shaders implemented, Display class does more loop control,
            file loading can be done on sub threads, TTF fonts can be used events
            can handle all types of input such as joystick, gamepad etc, Building
2012-12-08  class and clashtest shader detect bumping into things.


v0.07
2012-12-08  Added splash screen to TK window (also user defineable)
2012-12-07  LoaderEgg draw needed to disableClientState(GL_COLOR_ARRAY) as
            this affected the scene afterwards
2012-12-07  Added pi3d.FPS class that returns a Frames Per Second (FPS) count
2012-12-06  Found a problem with matrix stacking - a push would increase the
            stack but a pop would not reduce it (i.e. constantly increasing)
            Introduced a fixed stack method with a default of 20 deep pushes
            (or user defined, e.g. mtrx=pi3d.matrix(50) for fifty pushes)
            This should also speed things up a little as stack is pre-allocated
            upon intialisation.
2012-12-06  Separated perspective and orthographic code into setPerspective and
            setOrthographic functions so that a scene can interchange between them

v0.06
2012-11-29  Added Pi3D.DrawString2D which now renders text to a 2D orthographic view
2012-11-29  Added Pi3D.CollisionMap for checking collisions against objects.
            Includes a collideLine method to see if a line of fire will hit an object
2012-11-28  Pi3D.LodDraw3 and LodDraw3xyz added to enable Level Of Detail rendering
            for near, far and further models (or none at all) 
2012-11-27  Loading textures checks for duplicates and uses preloaded textures
            rather than loads them again
2012-11-26  Drawing models (LoadModel) can use offset,rotation,scale and centre
            values added to their draw call (skips a matrix calculation)
2012-11-18  Modified loadECfiles to support other image types and an option not to
            render the bottom image
2012-11-17  Added Pi3D.tkwin class for creating and handling TKinter window and events.
            Much improved keyboard and mouse handling
2012-11-17  Modified Pi3D display class to resize the viewport and destroy correctly.
            Includes a seperate method to create_surface
2012-11-17  Adopted Paddy Gaunt's fixes and additions to Pi3D module including
            LoadModel (Obj format) and ClashTest

v0.05
2012-07-20  Add textures class so that textures can be deleted correctly
2012-07-20  Fixed a couple of bugs with latest release of Raspbian Wheezy
2012-07-12  Amended mergeShape to include shape's existing parameters
            (x,y,z,rotations, scale)
2012-07-12  Added Paddy's fog effect
2012-07-12  ForestWalk2.py - I broke it Paddy! - left tiled texture in
2012-07-12  Modified ForestWalk.py to include new FACES type environment cube
2012-07-12  Added loadECfiles def in Pi3D to help load faces textures for
            environment cube (FACES type)
2012-07-12  Made robotWalkabout.py that demostrates avatar viewing with an
            offset camera
2012-07-12  Swapped height and depth parameters in pi3d.createCuboid - was
            confusing with x,y,z ordering
2012-07-12  Updated clouds3d.py with Paddy's improved z-sorted version
2012-07-12  Added more environment cubes (FACES, HALFCROSS, CROSS) and added
            Github Wiki page
